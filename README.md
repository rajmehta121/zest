Due to busy schedule of teachers and students, there is a communication gap between them. With context to authenticity students always have confusion regarding the reliability of available source. Since students are free to explore there is a possibility of encountering problems whose solutions are
beyond the scope of syllabus. Hence to bridge the communication gap between students and teachers we will provide a platform where users can gain information and review it.


The web application will be used by the students to solve their issues regarding any topic and to gain more information which will be provided by the teachers.
1. Firstly, the user will need to register on the web portal. On the other hand, after the user registers there will be updates in the database where
the users data will be stored accordingly.
2. After registration, when the user logs in the user will be shown the home page where in the page will consist of the posts which the user is interested
in.
3. Also, there will be a side navigation bar where the topics will be listed.
4. Since this is a data-centric product it will need somewhere to store the data for which a database will be used.
5. When the user needs to search for a particular topic, the request for relevant posts about the topic will be sent to the server which in turn will
show the user the list of the posts.
